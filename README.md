# DnDHelper
An app that will do DnD things. TBD

- data -> repositories, data sources
- domain -> use cases, (where I can find them)
- ui -> compose, view models

## Root Screens
- Characters - will be a list of PC's and NPC's (filterable via a bottomsheet)
- Encounters - list of generated encounters (combat and non-combat?)
- Settings - settings
